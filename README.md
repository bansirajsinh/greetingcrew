GreetingCrew is a simple Flutter-based mobile application designed to showcase various greeting templates in a visually appealing grid layout. The home screen features six neatly arranged grid items, each displaying a unique template name along with an icon or image, allowing users to easily browse through options. Tapping on any grid item navigates the user to a detailed page specific to that template, making it ideal for selecting, customizing, or previewing greeting card designs. With its clean black-and-white UI theme, intuitive navigation, and reusable component structure, GreetingCrew serves as a foundation for building digital greeting card apps, celebration planners, or creative portfolioÂ displays.
